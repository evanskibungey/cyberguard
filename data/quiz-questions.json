    "options": [
      "Click the link immediately to avoid account suspension",
      "Reply to the email with your credentials to verify",
      "Check the sender domain carefully — 'paypa1.com' uses a number '1' instead of the letter 'l', then report it as phishing",
      "Forward the email to your contacts to warn them"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "This is a classic homograph/typosquatting attack. The domain 'paypa1.com' substitutes the letter 'l' with the number '1'. Always inspect the sender's full email address. Legitimate companies will never threaten immediate account suspension via email requiring emergency credential entry."

    "question": "An email arrives appearing to be from your IT department saying 'Your Office 365 password expires today. Click here to reset it.' The link shows a URL beginning with 'http://'. What is suspicious here?",
    "options": [
      "Nothing — IT departments regularly send password reset emails",
      "The email is using HTTP instead of HTTPS, meaning it is not encrypted and is likely a phishing site",
      "The deadline of 'today' sounds urgent but is normal",
      "Office 365 passwords do expire, so this is probably legitimate"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Legitimate corporate IT systems and Microsoft always use HTTPS. An HTTP link for a login page is a major red flag. Additionally, urgency ('expires today') is a classic social engineering pressure tactic. Always navigate directly to known trusted URLs instead of clicking email links."

    "question": "You receive an email that passed your spam filter. The From address shows 'Amazon <orders@amazon.com>' but when you hover over the reply button, the reply-to address is 'amazon-support@free-mailer.net'. What does this indicate?",
    "options": [
      "Amazon uses multiple email providers, so this is normal",
      "The Reply-To address is different from the From address — this is a spoofing technique to harvest replies on an attacker-controlled server",
      "Free-mailer.net is a legitimate Amazon subsidiary",
      "This means the email was forwarded by Amazon's system"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "A mismatch between the From address and Reply-To address is a strong phishing indicator. Attackers spoof the visible From address to look legitimate but set the Reply-To to a server they control. Any reply or sensitive information you send will go to the attacker, not Amazon."

      "Forward it to your bank's email address first, then open it"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Banks never send executable or PDF instructions requiring action through unsolicited emails. Malicious PDFs can contain exploits or macro scripts. Always contact your bank through verified channels — the number on your card or the official website — not through contact details provided in the suspicious email."

    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Extreme urgency combined with threats ('lose access') is the hallmark of phishing. Attackers create panic to make victims act without thinking. Legitimate services rarely use all-caps subjects with emergency threats and unrealistic deadlines. Always pause and verify through official channels when a message creates fear."

Always verify by calling the number printed on the back of your debit/credit card or on the bank's official website. Never trust contact details embedded in unsolicited messages."

    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Unsolicited 'you've won' texts are classic smishing lures. The shortened URL hides the actual destination, which is likely a credential harvesting page or malware download. Real sweepstakes notify winners through official registered channels. If you didn't enter a contest, you cannot have won it."

    "explanation": "The words 'secure' or 'bank' in a URL do not make a site legitimate — attackers use them deliberately to appear trustworthy. The actual domain here is 'secure-bankofamerica-login.com', not 'bankofamerica.com'. Always check the domain name immediately after 'https://' in the address bar."

    "options": [
      "Yes — HTTPS and the padlock mean the site is verified and safe",
      "No — HTTPS only means the connection is encrypted, not that the site itself is trustworthy or not a phishing site",

      "No — padlock icons can only appear on fake sites"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "HTTPS and the padlock icon only guarantee that data is encrypted in transit between your browser and the server. They say nothing about the legitimacy of the website. Phishing sites routinely obtain free HTTPS certificates (e.g., from Let's Encrypt) to appear legitimate. Always verify the full domain name."

    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Multiple simultaneous red flags — no reviews, empty pages, wire-transfer-only payment — strongly indicate a fraudulent site. Wire transfers are not reversible and are preferred by scammers for this reason. Credit card payments offer consumer protection. Any single one of these signs warrants caution; all three together mean avoid immediately."

An attacker could have compromised your colleague's account to send this message."

The label is designed to make you curious enough to plug it in. Always hand unknown storage devices to IT security unopened. Never plug in unknown USB drives."
